Changes:
 - Grey out empty layers in layer viewer
 - Order of layers is now repeating sequence of [tracks, regions, pads, boundaries]
 - Boundary layer always rendered as dark even when it's a clear layer (to aid troubleshooting)
 - Added loading of drill files
 - Used paths for rendering layers - hole rendering is now correct
 - Aperture macros:
     - Apertures macros with clear flags now work correctly
     - Implemented macro primitives 1, 20, 21 and 22
     - Fixed subtle filling bug for apertures - all apertures created must be CCW - outline
       primitive (4) will reverse points automatically to ensure this is true
     - Implemented macro variables and expressions
         Note: It is unclear whether variables are reset between AD commands - current
         implementation is that they stick until overridden - either by macro or macro parameter
     - All aperture macros should be fully implemented now EXCEPT for the moire and thermal primitives
         >> Testing is still required!
     - Fixed bug when parsing macro comments (0)

Todo:
 - Step and repeat (SR)
 - Check conversion is correct when drill file with different unit from gerber file is loaded

 Bugs:
  - Clicking on whitespace of layers checkboxes will set to wrong value for some reason
