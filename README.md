# lazercam

To run, you'll need to install Python, wxPython and Pyclipper library. The minimum files needed to run lazercam are the .py files in the root directory. Once files have been downloaded, run "LazorApp.py".

Files in folder "old" are old or experimental versions of main code. They can be ignored.
